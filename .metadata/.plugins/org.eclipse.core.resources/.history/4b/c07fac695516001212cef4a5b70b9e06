	// Write a short program to display discount and final price for sale item
	// Discount is 10% if the purchase price is $10 or less
	// Discount is 20% if the purchase price is more than $10
	// test for purchases less than $10, exactly $10, and greater than $10
	
	// $purchase is the purchase price input by the user
	// $discount is the discount amount
	// $dpercent is the percent of the discount: 10 or 20
	// $finalcost is the cost to the purchaser after the discount
	
	$break="<br>";
	
	// Make sure the purchase price is valid - that is, it is greater than zero
	
		if ($purchase<=0){
			print "You have entered an invalid purchase price - Please try again"; 
			
	// Purchase price of $10 dollars or less entitles the customer to a 10% discount
			
		} elseif ($purchase<=10){
				$discount=$purchase*0.10;
				$dpercent=10;
	
	// Purchase price over $10 entitles purchaser to a 20% discount
		} else {
				$discount=$purchase*0.20;
				$dpercent=20;
		}
				
		$finalcost=$purchase-$discount;
		
		print "If your total purchase price is $";
		
	// referred to page 285 of Murach's PHP and MySQL book for printf syntax

		print ", you get a discount of ";
		print $dpercent."%";
		print $break;
