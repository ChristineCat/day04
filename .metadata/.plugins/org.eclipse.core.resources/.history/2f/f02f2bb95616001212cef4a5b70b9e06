	// Write a short program to display discount and final price for sale item
	// Discount is 10% if the purchase price is $10 or less
	// Discount is 20% if the purchase price is more than $10
	// test for purchases less than $10, exactly $10, and greater than $10
	
	// $purchase is the purchase price input by the user
	// $discount is the discount amount
	// $dpercent is the percent of the discount: 10 or 20
	// $finalcost is the cost to the purchaser after the discount
